---+ info directory README

This directory contains libs useful for displaying specialized
types of information. Examples would be

 * Maps
 * Flash
 * Youtube/vimeo/etc embedding
 * Chart and graph packages
 * Markup languages and HTML editors
 
 
 When we have, or might reasonably have, more than one provider for
 an info type (e.g. maps), we'll try to have an abstract lib that wraps
 the specific libs.
 
 Using the abstract lib rather than the specific one is recommended.
 
 For some of these the information provider requires an API key.
 The key files are in /keys
 Copy the foo.pl.example file to foo.pl and modify with your key.
