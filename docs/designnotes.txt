# Design notes for weblog

## Questions

Q: How does things like hierarchical nav work with
generated content? e.g. the manual pages on the swipl site
A: The meta info is on a separate predicate, there's no reason
that pred can't be complex. Certainly the handler meta pred
itself should handle 'prefix'.

Q: Should the hierarchy be split between pages and chunks?
A:probably not. Too many places where this distinction's going to
make things awkward.
eg. directory menu.
Needs to be a unified way of naming everything in the site.

Q: Is it important to know how many items there are without
generating them all?
A: Yup. It is. 

## My Code Chunks

### Disclosure

Anything that discloses should be able to be marked for premium content

### Hierarchy

It's beginning to look like a unified way of enumerating a site hierarchy is an important thing to have. This is an information hierarchy, rather than a page hierarchy. E.g. a set of search results, shown 10 per page, would be a flat list of items, rather than a list of pages each with 10 items.

### Page Chunk

Ajax response with a chunk of a page, used for example for Accordion.

So, for example, accordion pattern could be 

\accordion([\a_section, \b_section, \c_section])

where the section content is actually generated within some ajax response.

### Discovery mode

It would be very cool to have a mode that added text attributes to most items so you could find out where information came from

### Handler Meta

Unified system for attaching meta information to handlers.

#### Handler Meta Information

 * Label - this is the default 'name' for the page (eg in the title)
 * tree navigation hierarchical navigation
 * K=V tags for Welie:faceted navigation, search, etc.
 * sequences (for wizards, stepping)
 * is this handler discoverable?
 * security - accessible by <role list>
 * home page flag ("I am the home page")
 * mini-page (e.g. for minesweeping)
 
#### Uses of Handler meta info
 
  * debug page with all handlers
  * site map
  * access control
  * navigation

### In-page hierarchy

introspectable page definition, separates content organization from presentation
within the context of a single page.

Could be meta info on tags?
Is the # anchor system useful here?

Used by:
 
* Welie:Accordion  (non ajax version)

### Special Content

#### Interactive Map 

#### Graphs

## Pattern selector

Having selection advice on on the site would be very useful.
Might even have a 'usage warn' mode like the debug mode that would
add 'such and such pattern might be better here' advice


## My Pattern List

### Navigation

Are the navigation patterns best served by being site nav vs. in page section nav?
e.g. Directory Navigation might be on a very long page

What about the multi-frame nav pattern common to, say, javadoc style browsers?


#### Welie:Accordion

User opens one panel at a time

Uses:
Hierarchical in-page organization

#### Welie:Headerless Menu

Combine menus in a vertical menu using different visual clues instead of headers 

Uses:
Hierarchical site organization
Labels

#### Welie: Breadcrumb

Uses:
Hierarchical site organization
Labels

### Debug

#### debug page with all handlers

#### debug page with broken links

#### site spider

#### syntax error flag

errors discovered during generation of page should produce a callout box describing error on the generation page, not a failure.
