  * There does not seem to be a need to make `demo/debug.pl`
    and `demo/load.pl` *modules*.
    Although the former does export predicates these do not seem to be used.
  
  * Make a user directory that handles login, registration, security roles,
    and profiles that goes beyond the current prototype.
  
  * What is the use of `format/wl_box.pl` and `format/wl_box.md`?
    It generates HTML boxes with round corners but this is acchieved by
    some CSS in `resource/css/demo.css` that is not loaded by the module.
