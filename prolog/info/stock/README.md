# info/stock directory README

This directory contains libs useful for displaying information
related to financial markets. Examples would be

 * stock market tickers
 * feeds of stock market info
 * currency converters
 
 The exact organization of this will probably evolve.
 
 When we have, or might reasonably have, more than one provider for
 an info type (e.g. maps), we'll try to have an abstract lib that wraps
 the specific libs.
