# info/books directory README

This directory contains libs useful for interacting with Google books.

Examples would be

 * Google Books viewer
 * Google Books search api
  
 As of this writing Google does not require an API key for these
 services.
 
 
 For some of these the information provider requires an API key.
 The key files are in /keys
 Copy the foo.pl.example file to foo.pl and modify with your key.
