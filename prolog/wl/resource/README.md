Resource directory
==================

This directory contains definitions for the swipl html_resource directory.

Static Files
------------

Usually when you add a file under this directory you'll want to add it to ./resources/resources.pl
so it's known as a resource in the system.

The icons directory is used by SWI-Prolog for it's own images. 

Not sure yet how images should go. Could split them between WebLog and outside, or use file path.
