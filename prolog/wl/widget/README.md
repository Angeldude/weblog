# widgets directory README

This directory contains libs that display a 'widget' which does NOT
fall into any of these categories:

* Display of a type of information (those are in info)
* Navigation (those are in nav)
* Help arranging the page (those are in formatting)

So far this category includes

* Clippy - a binding to clippy-js, a javascript implementation of the infamous Microsoft Agent
* Configurator - a tool for selecting options
