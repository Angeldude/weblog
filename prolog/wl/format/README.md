Format directory
================

This directory contains modules useful for controlling page layout.

This of course includes things like the table tool, but it also includes
some tools for dynamic bits of page motion like tabs you can slide out
to reveal extra info, lightboxes (the 'dialog' thing that darkens the rest of the page),
overlapping 'windows' (like a desktop), draggable rearrangeable objects.

In short, if you're wondering whether something belongs here or in nav,
if it's primary purpose is to navigate around the site, it belongs in nav.
If it's primary purpose is to deal with a lack of screen real estate
or to help layout a page, it belongs here.

Yes, that's vague.

Current modules:
  
  * wl_box.pl
  Supports visual boxes on screen with headers.
  
  * wl_tab.pl
  Support for slideout tabs.
  
  * wl_table.pl
  Support for tables of data.
