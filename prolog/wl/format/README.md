Format directory
================

This directory contains modules useful for formatting parts of a Web page
and for controlling Web layout.

This includes support for static elements like HTML tables
and support for dynamic page elements like sliding tabs,
lightboxes (= dialogs that darken the rest of the Web page),
desktop-like overlapping windows, draggable and/or rearrangeable elements.

There is a fine line between this directory and `/prolog/wl/nav`,
If a module's primary purpose is to navigate around a Web site
it belongs in `/prolog/wl/nav`.
If a module's s primary purpose is to deal with a lack of screen real estate
or to help layout a Web page it belongs here.
