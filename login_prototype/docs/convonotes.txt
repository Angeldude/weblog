a: including \login_box in our DOM give you this box
depending on if logged in

t: well, there's a session check, right?
 
a: yes, there needs to be some model for "logged in"
can we just destroy the session when someone logs out?
or even offer manual session creation on login?


t: currently a sessio nis created on login, and yeah, we can destroy on logout

a: some people wont' want that - liek a shopping site where you can put stuff in
cart when logged out

a: swipl by default always makes a session

qa: also, how is 'remember me on this computer?' implemented?

expire date on cookies,

a suggests using library(options) and option remember(forever) or
remember(30) to get the check
should it be checked by default?

a. suggests this should be looked at on web pattern sites and big web sites

t: classis list of options in login_box

t: some questions about how to implement the remember

a: cookies , use mailman to send it to head

t: should logout box replace login by default?

some discussion of this, needs research, t says sometimes want
to 

t never seen a persisting login so far

discussion of how github does it

sdiscussion of how the app dev handles different behavior depending on 
if we're logged in

and how much inheritance/granularity we need to support for layout of the login/logout boxes
